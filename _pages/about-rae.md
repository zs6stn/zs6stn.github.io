If you already know what Amateur Radio is and you want to do your licence, you have come to the right place.

## Class-A General Information

The recommended RAE course duration is approximately 12 weeks, but this could vary from club to club.
Times and days will also vary, so it is important to find out all the details and to get a schedule from the clubs RAE manager.
Note, clubs may arrange extra lessons or give revision classes from time to time. It is the individual candidate’s responsibility to attend every class and to catch up work, if classes are missed. Clubs will generally run a mock exam towards the end of the course and it is highly recommended that you attend these sessions.
We also suggest that you go and register at the following ham exam study site: [www.weprepare.co.za](https://www.weprepare.co.za/page-204-about-learning-and-development-module.html){:target="_blank"}
Do these exercises on a regular basis as they will stand you in good stead for the final exam.

As part of the RAE course you are required to learn how to operate an HF station in a safe manner without interfering with others.
This needs to be done using the correct operating procedures, and by abiding by the rules and regulations as set out by ICASA.
You need to make a minimum of five contacts and do a practical assessment on setting up the HF station.
There should be regular opportunities, during the course, for you to operate an HF station and make contact with other hams using a club call sign.
This will be done under supervision of a suitable qualified Amateur Radio operator.
The final HF assessment will be undertaken by an HF assessor as appointed by the SARL.
If you are not attending lectures and doing home study, then have a look at the following link and contact one of the listed HF assessors in your area: [http://www.sarl.org.za/Web3/RAE/HFAssessorsPublic.aspx](http://www.sarl.org.za/Web3/RAE/HFAssessorsPublic.aspx){:target="_blank"}

The final assessment, including the logbook and declaration by the assessors, needs to be handed in at the latest with the final exam papers.
